MATLAB and C++ code utilized to analyze both single and dual-channel luminescence imaging experiments in 2 papers during my PhD:

-“Quantitative relationships between SMAD dynamics and target gene activation kinetics in single live cells”, Scientific Reports.
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-41870-2

-"CAST: An automated segmentation and tracking tool for the analysis of transcriptional kinetics from single-cell time-lapse recordings.", Methods
